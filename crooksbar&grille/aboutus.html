    <h1 id="welcometocrookstitle">Striving for Quality</h1>
    <p class="fullbodypara">Here at Crooks, Nothing is more important to us than the experience that you have here. With that in mind, we craft our dishes to be of the utmost quality, as well as retaining the casual environment that we work to make Crooks. We take guest comfort extremely seriously and to that end we've installed some of the best furniture that we can to make sure that you and anyone else can enjoy their meal while still being comfortable. We also put great thought into the lighting at Crooks, with the setup the we have hand-crafted being gentle on the eyes, while still retaining the amount of light you would expect to find at any other establishment. Our utmost hope is that all of these factors combine to make an enjoyable dining experience, as well as an enjoyable social experience.</p>
    <h1 id="othertitle">A Team of Friends</h1>
    <p class="fullbodypara">Crooks was founded all the way back in 1992 by two good friends, Jim Crook and Ben Wector. They built Crooks into what it is today, and even though they have retired, we carry on the philosophy of a team of friends, with all of our staff members knowing each other closely. We believe that having a staff that can work comfortably together and that can socialize with each other makes for a better working environment, as well as a better environment for the customer. It is with this belief that we proudly carry on the tradition of friendship that founded Crooks.</p>
