    <h3 class="coursedesc">AP Computer Science Principles is an introductory computing course. Students cultivate their
      understanding of computer science through working with data, collaborating to solve problems, and
      developing computer programs as they explore concepts like creativity, abstraction, data and information,
      algorithms, programming, the internet, and the global impact of computing. It also allows students the
      opportunity to investigate the innovations in other fields that computing has made possible and examines
      the ethical implications of new computing technologies.
      **Students are encouraged, but not required to take the Advanced Placement exam for this course in May.</h3>

      AP Computer Science A is an introductory college-level computer science course. Students cultivate their
      understanding of coding through analyzing, writing, and testing code as they explore concepts like
      modularity, variables, and control structures. Students use the standard Java library from the AP Java
      subset delineated by College Board. The responsible use of these systems is reinforced throughout the
      course.
      **Students are encouraged, but not required to take the Advanced Placement exam for this course which
      takes place in May</h3>
