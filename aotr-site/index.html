      <h1 class="title">What is Aftershocks of the Revolutions?</h1>
      <hr class="whatis">
      <p class="para">We are defined by our history. It turns, and bends, down the river of time, and we are carried down its ferocious stream. But in 1848, the river failed to flow, and upon its banks did the hopes and dreams of free people smother and drown in drought. The river was reformed by humankind. But the casualty to democracy and liberty was incalculable.</p>
      <p class="para">This is not the case in AOTR. The river of time finds its own way, and the world is forever reshaped. In this 1848, Metternich's continental scheme collapses, and because of it, a cascade of consequence leads us to 1936; a world where a liberal Germany dominates, Italy is divorced from nationhood by external powers, the Habsburgs curl around Vienna, and the Russian Tsar hangs onto tender hooks. In a world where revolutions succeeded, evolution must come next. The next evolution of history, and of our species, is passed down to you in Aftershocks of the Revolutions.  Perhaps the greatest revolution is yet to occur, or you will personally reverse the river of history. Perhaps your nation is destined for greatness never before seen; perhaps we are all destined to suffer under the smothering flow of this indifferent river. In AOTR, you decide.</p>
      <p class="para">In Aftershocks, you are the earthquake.</p>
